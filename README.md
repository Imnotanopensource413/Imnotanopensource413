- 👋 Hi, I’m @Imnotanopensource413
- 👀 I’m interested in ...no longer allowing anything to do with me or my physical body or anything involved with technology to ever be used by anyone ever again 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... that humanity has no morals or accountability and want to be given instead of asking if it's okay 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... who has ever used any form of open source programming or network concerning myself 
- 📫 How to reach me ... well your using open source so you already know but know that I am going to go through each and every single homepage that is listed on my device and write this same thing. my name is Travis David Johnson and I do not consent or allow anything concerning myself or online presence including from the satellites floating in space to the electricity flowing through the earth to be used on me for anything or anyone period
